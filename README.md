## Description

In this project I demonstrated the work with animations. Snow is falling in the background, adding to the atmospheric feel, and there is also an animation of a spinning drum for a casino.
Also taken into account is the ability to change the chance of a prize falling out. In addition, when hovering over a button, a 3D effect is applied, which makes the interface more interactive and attractive.
